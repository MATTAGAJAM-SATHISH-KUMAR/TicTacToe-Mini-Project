A very simple text-based.
2-player tictactoe game in Java.

/* **The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid.***/ 
The game is played by two players, who take turns.

**The first player marks moves with a '1', the second with a '2'.**
The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins. 

This program draws the game board, asks the user for the coordinates (row#, col#) of the next mark, changes the players after every successful move, and pronounces the winner.

GUI(Graphical user Interface) to come, with JavaFX.

For now, run the .java file as a simple java class in Eclipse Or VScode and play it on the console.
